The question is to find the minimum in rotated array, if the end value is larger than the first value, which means the list is not rotated and return nums[0], if not which means the list is rotated, there are several corner cases which are when nums[mid] >nums[mid+1] which means nums[mid+1] is the smallest, the same as nums[mid-1]>nums[mid], the other two cases are when nums[0] < nums[mid] which means mid point is in left range now, we need to find the right part starting point, so update start = mid + 1, else end = mid -1.
